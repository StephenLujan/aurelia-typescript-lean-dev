## Running The App

To run the app, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
3. Ensure that [jspm](http://jspm.io/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g jspm
  ```
4. Install the client-side dependencies with jspm:

  ```shell
  jspm install -y
  ```
5. Install live-server
In this simplified sample we are not using gulp. Instead we use live-server
  ```shell
  npm install live-server -g
  ```
6. Start live-server
  ```shell
  live-server
  ```
